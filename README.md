Random Language Generation Programs

The idea is that by automatically generating linguistic strings of arbitrary length, new novels can be generated from random number generation, and new scientific theories can be developed or inspired from randomly genererated statements.

The lingustic Noam Chomsky spoke of the need to find language's "scope and limits". Chomsky and his group assert mysterianism, I propose that simply the ability to see that language is built of a finite amount of syllables already gives us hints to the scope and limits of language, and how languages grow to incorporate new ideas.

These programs are the next step.
